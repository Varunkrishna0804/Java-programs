    <h1>THE THIRSTY CROW</h1>
    <h2>After flying a long distance, a thirsty crow wandered the forest searching for water.
     Finally, he saw a pot half-filled with water.
      He tried to drink from it, but his beak wasn’t long enough to reach the water inside.
       He then saw pebbles on the ground, and one by one, he put them in the pot until the water rose to the brim.
        The crow then hastily drank from it and quenched his thirst.
